### Project Description: AI/ML Disaster Prediction System

**Project Overview:**
This project involves developing a web application that predicts natural disasters using AI/ML models. The frontend will be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing users with an interface to input data and view predictions. The backend, built with Java Spring Boot, will handle the processing of inputs and utilize pre-trained AI/ML models to make predictions. The system will include automated testing to ensure the application is robust and accurate.

#### Frontend:
- **HTML**: Construct the layout for data input forms, display sections for predictions, and control buttons.
- **CSS**: Style the application to ensure a professional, user-friendly, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Manage user interactions, make asynchronous requests to the backend, and dynamically update the UI based on the prediction results.

#### Backend:
- **Java Spring Boot**: Serve as the backend to handle requests from the frontend, process data inputs, and interface with AI/ML models for disaster prediction.
